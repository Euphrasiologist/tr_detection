# Data in this folder

Some of this is from the 2019 Fajkus paper [1].

- I took all the fasta sequences from the supplementary
- Aligned them
- Created an HMM
- Ran this HMM across all DToL genomes
- Appended new TR sequences
- Created new HMM from this data.

## Files

- TR* are the original sequences taken from [1]
- fajkus_dtol* contain the appended DToL sequences.
- all* have hymenoptera added (of less utility as the sequences are quite divergent)
- arceuthobium* are files Petr has sent me for *Viscum* analysis
