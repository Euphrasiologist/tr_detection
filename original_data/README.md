# Data from Fajkus paper

- I took all the fasta sequences from the supplementary
- Aligned them
- Created an HMM
- Ran this HMM across all DToL genomes
- Created new HMM from this data.

These sequences will be used to search for TR genes across all of our current genomes.

Current plan is to extract all copies of the TR gene from a single genome. Analysis can then be done on these TR genes.
